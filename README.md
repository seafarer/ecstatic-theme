# ecstatic Theme
==============

A super basic WordPress starter theme based on _s that adds bourbon, neat, bitters, normalize, modernizr, jquery and ties it all together. Its set up to use libsass, livereload and grunt. A great starting point that just needs your design.

To get started, download the zip file or clone the repo. Then do a global search for "ecstatic" and replace it with the name of your theme. To use the grunt task runner and libsass run `npm install` in the theme folder and then to watch for changes and to reload the browser run `grunt`.
